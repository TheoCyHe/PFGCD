                        <p class="text-white-50">
                          Gentrification is the process by which a neighborhood is transformed from low-value to high-value, marked by increasing housing costs, new construction of more advanced infrastructure, and changes in resident demographics, among others. It increases the quality of life in an area, with benefits ranging from increased safety and improved infrastructure to better availability and quality of education and job opportunities. However, the original residents of the poor neighborhoods that are targeted in gentrification are too often displaced by the rising value of the area and left in a similar, if not worse, situation than their previous one. This happens in three main ways – many old residents are pushed out due to the increased standard of living and taxes from higher property values (direct displacement), potential new residents with lower incomes are prevented from moving in for the same reason (indirect/exclusionary displacement), and the character of the neighborhood shifts completely to cater to new, more well-off residents, alienating the previous residents that remain (cultural displacement). Displacement through gentrification exacerbates the economic inequality present in our country, widening the gap between the rich and poor as even more resources (in the form of land, positioning, etc.) are taken from the impoverished and directed toward those who are already well-to-do. Displacement also deepens social inequalities, as it disproportionately affects historically oppressed minorities, who are inherently more vulnerable due to the effects of discrimination, both past and present (e.g. such minorities tend to have a lower socioeconomic status as a result of oppressing groups pushing them down to a lower place in society or subhuman status in the past, which means that they are more likely to live in an area that will become subject to gentrification).

                        <p class="text-white-50">
                          Philadelphia is one of the oldest and most famous cities in the United States. It was in Philadelphia that the Founding Fathers drafted and signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. It was Philadelphia that served as the nation’s capital until construction of Washington D.C. was completed. It was in Philadelphia that the first library, hospital, and stock exchange of the United States were founded. Philadelphia has been and remains a major educational and economic center, and it is the home to one of the most diverse communities in America, with a population that is 42.1% black or African American, 34.5% non-Hispanic white, 14.7% Hispanic or Latino, and 7.2% Asian (remaining percentages comprised of those who identify as American Indian, Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander, or mixed). However, it is also one of the cities suffering the greatest from gentrification and displacement. Two of the top ten most gentrified zip codes in the United States in February 2018 were Philadelphian ones – 19123 (Northern Liberties) and 19146 (Graduate Hospital and Point Breeze), and one can clearly observe the negative effects of gentrification in Philadelphia – the Federal Reserve Bank documented the loss of 23,628 rental units available at $750 or less from 2000 to 2014, with affordable rental units in gentrifying neighborhoods being lost at a rate five times greater than those in non-gentrifying neighborhoods.

                        <p class="text-white-50">
                          PFGCD is a grassroots organization that aims to prevent or mitigate gentrification-linked displacement, stopping an influx of wealth and resources from pushing out the original, low-income inhabitants of poor neighborhoods and allowing them to benefit from urban development and investment alongside the rest of the city. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as giving property tax cuts to previous residents of a gentrified area, expanding public housing, or establishing community benefit agreements with investors in development projects. We wish to spread awareness about the issue posed by displacement in Philadelphia and facilitate discussion around the problem and possible solutions. We raise public awareness through advertising, such as by distributing pamphlets, setting up posters, and posting on social media, and through demonstrations (e.g. marches, picketing, and rallies). We also use demonstrations to pressure the government, urban development planners, or investors to take action to help combat the effects of gentrification-caused displacement, and lobby for legislation that supports our cause. By raising awareness and pushing forward our agenda, we hope to revitalize struggling communities in Philadelphia, promoting equity by creating a world where all can benefit from gentrification.
