                      In theory, gentrification and urban development should benefit humanity – an increase in the quality of one neighborhood should result in an increase in the overall quality of the city, the nation, and human civilization as a whole. However, in practice, gentrification ends up creating more divisions in society and widening existing ones because of the greed and selfishness of corporations and the wealthy, and the negligence of the government.
                      <br><br>
                      The conversion of run-down apartment buildings into high-end housing like condominiums or high-rises may look and seem like an improvement, but what it really does is drive up property values, which in turn raises the cost of living in the area. The original inhabitants of said run-down apartment buildings are forced out and move into a different area of similar or lower quality than their previous neighborhood, while already affluent people move into the high-end housing, taking over the area. Thus, the gap between the wealthy and the poor widens.
                      <br><br>
                      Similarly, rising building prices often push developers to transform residential areas into commercial ones, as it becomes more profitable for investors. Due to the resulting demand for land, many landlords often unethically evict or pressure tenants out so they can sell their low-end rental units for higher prices, thus directly displacing poorer residents who cannot afford to own their housing.
                      <br><br>
                      Furthermore, as higher-income residents move in and lower-income residents are forced out, the community’s character shifts to meet their tastes (services, amenities, events/gatherings, etc.), effectively alienating the few remaining original inhabitants of the area by placing them into a completely different culture that they are very much ‘left out of’.
                      <br><br>
                      After an area is completely gentrified, it may have increased safety, improved infrastructure, and better availability and quality of education and job opportunities, but the only ones who benefit are the upper echelon, and the poorer class suffers disproportionately as a result. Although investors, urban developers, and the wealthy may call it ‘progress’, one can much more accurately label this interaction with the word ‘parasitism’.
                      <br><br>
                      Gentrification-linked displacement also deepens existing social inequalities, as it has a disproportionate effect on certain groups.
                      <br><br>
                      According to research conducted by Stanford sociologist Jackelyn Hwang and Lei Ding, Community Development Senior Economic Advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the negative effects of gentrification fall disproportionately on historically oppressed minorities, since they have less options to work with. For example, they have fewer and worse neighborhoods available to move to after being displaced – as stated by Hwang, such minorities have, “additional constraints when they move, leading them to move to a shrinking set of affordable yet disadvantaged neighborhoods within the city,” as opposed to white residents, who, “tend to move to wealthier neighborhoods in the city and in the suburbs,” and, “have more advantage when they go into the housing market.”  This exacerbates the racial inequality present in society, “shrinking residential options within cities for disadvantaged residents and expanding them for more advantaged residents.”
                      <br><br>
                      Moreover, the shifting character of gentrifying neighborhoods often unfairly excludes people of color and low-income individuals, of whom a disproportionate amount are minorities. As stated by Winnie Tam Hung, Ph.D. in Ethnic, Cultural Minority, Gender, and Group Studies, urban development is selective, “investing the city with money and consumption-oriented spaces that resemble suburban shopping malls that exclude [individuals of] low-income and people of color,” rather than aiming to, “foster community formation.”
                      <br><br>
                      Another group more vulnerable to displacement is the elderly. According to Professor Rowland Atkinson, Research Chair in Inclusive Societies at the University of Sheffield, physical and mental frailty brought about by age make it more difficult for elderly people to deal with gentrification. For instance, their physical condition prevents them from resisting landlords who attempt to pressure tenants out of rental units by doing things like cutting off utilities. In addition, the elderly are hit harder by the social changes of cultural displacement – “many older adults cited loss of friendships or community networks as a reason to move.”
                      <br><br>
                      While gentrification and displacement can be observed in cities around the world, we should first aim to ignite change in our own city. Philadelphia is one of seven cities which account for almost half of America’s gentrification, and ranks high in displacement of low-income people of color, according to research by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. In Point Breeze, incomes rose from $29,342 to $37,879, and in Northern Liberties/Fishtown, incomes leapt from $59,280 to $81,889, all during the period of time from 2000 to 2013. Meanwhile, almost 12,000 African American Philadelphian residents were forced out of their neighborhoods. In West Philly alone, the Black population decreased by 35% from 2000 to 2016 due to rising rent and home prices. Many existing measures are also ineffective – for example, subsidized housing is targeted toward people earning between 60-80% of the regional area median annual income, $87,400, but for low-income minority areas like West Philadelphia, which has a median annual income of approximately $30,000, such subsidized housing does little to help these countless low-income residents at risk of displacement.
                      <br><br>
                      However, there is still hope. Philadelphian homeowners are less threatened by displacement than homeowners in other cities, due to newly implemented programs that attempt to keep property taxes from skyrocketing and to help people keep their property. For example, the Senior Freeze Program and Longtime Owner Occupant Program freeze real-estate taxes for low-income homeowners over the age of 65 and homeowners who have held ownership for 10 or more years and whose tax assessments have risen by at least 300% in a year. You can help, too! The people are the foundation of our government, and, by raising awareness and pushing for change, we can help maintain the upkeep of such existing programs, improve upon current measures, and implement new programs or legislation that aid the victims of displacement or help prevent it altogether.
