                      Jayron Mardani is a BA Candidate in Urban Studies at Columbia University, and has been involved with Columbia's Housing Equity Project. This interview was conducted by Theodore He on 06/13/21.
                      <br><br><br><br>
                      1. What are your thoughts on the link between gentrification/displacement and existing
                      social inequalities?
                      <br><br>
                      By definition, the term stems from the concept of the “gentry”, or people of good social standing,
                      moving into a relatively disinvested neighborhood, initiating a series of upgrades and
                      transformation that result in the displacement of the original residents of the neighborhood. In
                      essence, it is the replacement of the existing population by the gentry. This dynamic of gentry
                      versus original population fundamentally feeds on existing social inequalities. A prime example
                      seen in the United States are the lasting harmful effects of racial segregation and discrimination.
                      Through state-sanctioned practices such as redlining and discriminatory lending, neighborhoods
                      of color often suffer from massive disinvestment. These factors among many more often result in
                      low property values- something that can attract pioneer gentrifiers. As more and more gentrifiers
                      take advantage of low property values (sometimes the added appeal of moving into an “authentic
                      neighborhood”), markets respond to these attractions. Slowly, the shifting demographics of the
                      neighborhood result in elements meant to cater to the incoming gentry rather than the original
                      residents, and as demand increases, property values rise as well. All these processes work to
                      alienate the original residents and exploit the environment that was created by discriminatory
                      practices.
                      <br><br><br>
                      2. What do you think are the best solutions to gentrification-caused displacement? What is
                      your opinion on the idea of gentrifying without displacing (e.g. by reducing property tax
                      for long-time residents, expanding public housing, or establishing community benefit
                      agreements with investors) – is it entirely unrealistic, or something to aim for?
                      <br><br>
                      Working to prevent physical displacement is definitely something to aim for. The suggestion of
                      establishing a CBA with investors is one that can produce mixed results, and sometimes
                      convolute the immediate needs of long-term residents. Increasing access to subsidized housing is
                      another straightforward-sounding solution that of course requires larger commitment from the
                      developers, managers, and neighborhood residents. The construction of subsidized housing is
                      often contested by the gentry as an undesirable addition to a neighborhood, which may be
                      negatively reflected in the markets, meaning that there are various aspects and ramifications of
                      such a development that need to considered and controlled for by all parties involved.
                      All of this being said, physical displacement is not the only form of displacement that long-time
                      residents are subject to. While a long-term resident may be able to remain in their neighborhood.
                      the rapidly changing dynamics and demographics of their neighborhood unquestionably create a
                      sense of isolation and displacement. The neighborhood as they knew it- the community,
                      familiarity, security, has changed.
                      <br><br><br>
                      3. Even if low-income residents are able to stay in a gentrified neighborhood, the character
                      of the neighborhood often shifts completely to cater to new, more well-off residents,
                      alienating those that remain. How can this effect be prevented or mitigated?
                      <br><br>
                      In my opinion, this seems difficult to fully achieve. I imagine that it requires a deep level of
                      understanding from incoming residents occupying the neighborhood. The people that move in to
                      gentrifying neighborhoods bear a large responsibility. It’s important to acknowledge the role one
                      is playing in the larger systems of displacement and inequality. I’m hesitant to say that cultural
                      displacement can be fully prevented, but mitigation is something to strive for (even if it may
                      seem unattainable). Maintaining the authentic culture of a neighborhood as it undergoes
                      gentrification is often something that is fought for by long-term residents, and is sometimes
                      overlooked by the larger parties involved such as development corporations, wealthy institutions,
                      or incoming residents. Temporary fixes may include restrictions on large corporations or chain
                      businesses moving into a neighborhood, but the idealism of such solutions must be met face-to-
                      face with the often compelling monetary incentives given to such corporations.
                      <br><br><br>
                      4. Who should hold the responsibility of preventing displacement? The government? Urban
                      development projects? What about the responsibility of helping already-displaced
                      people?
                      <br><br>
                      The systems that perpetuate the harms of gentrification and displacement are extremely complex
                      in that they entwine entities as large as the federal government to those as insignificant as a
                      single person searching for an apartment. At risk of oversimplification, the government holds an
                      extremely large responsibility in preventing and mitigating displacement. Throughout US
                      history, federal, state, and local governments have allowed and sometimes even created methods
                      of active discrimination and neglect against disadvantaged populations. Even with recent
                      acknowledgements of the harms of the past, some institutions are hesitant to acknowledge the
                      lasting effects that continue to ravage said populations. There needs to be a complete
                      understanding of the state’s (continued) role in the historical practices and ideologies that have
                      resulted in the societal crises we face today. Only then can there be comprehensive proposals on
                      what must be done to support the communities that have been left behind for so long. These
                      proposals may include actions such as increased funding and investment directly into
                      disadvantaged neighborhoods, altered zoning laws and tax incentives, and much more (not
                      excluding reparations).
